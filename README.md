# Stock-Price-Prediction-ML-with-Python-ML
This project collects historical stock data using **Yahoo Finance API**, preprocesses it, and applies **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks to predict future stock prices. The dataset is normalized, split into training and testing sets, and used to train the **LSTM model** with multiple layers for better accuracy.
A **Flask web application** is built to take a stock ticker as input, fetch real-time data, and predict the next-day closing price. Finally, the model and web app can be deployed using **Heroku, AWS, or Docker** for real-world accessibility.
